#
#	To compile GLFW for X11, you need to have the X11 
#	and OpenGL header packages installed, as well as the 
#	basic development tools like GCC and make. 
#	For example, on Ubuntu and other distributions 
#	based on Debian GNU/Linux, you need to install 
#	the xorg-dev and libgl1-mesa-dev packages. 
#	The former pulls in all X.org header packages 
#	and the latter pulls in the Mesa OpenGL development 
#	packages. Note that using header files and libraries 
#	from Mesa during compilation will not tie your binaries 
#	to the Mesa implementation of OpenGL.
