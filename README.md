Graphics laboratory
====================

Overview
---------------------
The project has no meaning for anybody apart of me. 
Is just a way of ordering projects into groups, 
and a method to motivate myself to return to 
older projects.

It contains:
* a script to clone all projects;
* a script to install general dependencies;
* small experimental projects;
* vim/sublime/ide project's files.
* todo lists for projects.
